# ScriptCube üßä
Java manager of shell script executions. Sort your .sh files execution just by editing a cube (file containing the complete path of your scripts).

## Requirements üîó
- Java 8+
- GNU/Linux or WSL

## Quick usage guide üìö
Create a text file with the scripts in order:
```bash
~/scripts/old_backups_cleaner.sh
~/scripts/create_new_backup.sh
~/scripts/schedule_frequent_backups.sh
```

Run .jar passing the cube path as argument:
```bash
java -jar ~/projects/script-cube/target/scriptcube-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
    ~/sripts/backups-cube.txt
```

Sample response:
```bash
cube: ~/scripts/backups-cube.txt

script: ~/scripts/old_backups_cleaner.sh
timeOfLastExecution: 12:54:59.106418424

script: ~/scripts/create_new_backup.sh
timeOfLastExecution: 12:54:59.108572523

script: ~/scripts/schedule_frequent_backups.sh
timeOfLastExecution: 12:54:59.111525863
```

You can also pass --sm (stop mode) as the last argument in the jar call, this will stop the cube if any script returns a status code other than 0.
